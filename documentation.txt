This file serves as a documentation for all (probably will end up being just most) of the actions I have taken in this development.

Format:
[DATE | TIME]
-Action1

-Action3

---------------------------------

[11-9-16 | 2:21 pm]
-Created Rails framework
-In Gemfile, added 
		[gem 'therubyracer', platforms: :ruby]
 to satisfy what the terminal keeps spitting out about javascript runtime and stuff.
 -Yaaaaaaaaassss local server's functioning and everything

---------------------------------

[11-21-16 | 12:03 pm]
-Added default page
-Implemented Bootstrap
	*Remember to restart server with [$ rails s] because of error after @import bootstrap
-In 'development.rb', set [config.assets.debug] to false because of slow view rendering

[11-21-16 | 3:14 pm]
-Home Page fundamentals up
	-Found color palette

---------------------------------

[11-22-16 | 1:22 pm]
-Added "How to Play" page
-smh right now I'm not even adhering to DRY principles.
	-For now, getting pages up and running, then before implementing group database, will translate all code to Ruby on Rails-happy layout (helpers, ruby syntax, etc)
